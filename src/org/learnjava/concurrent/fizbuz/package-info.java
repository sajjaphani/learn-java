/**
 * <p>
 * In the classic problem FizzBuzz, you are told to print the numbers from 1 to
 * n. However, when the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz". When it is
 * divisible by 5, print "Buzz". When it is divisible by 3 and 5,
 * print"FizzBuzz''.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Implement a multi-threaded version of FizzBuzz with four threads. One thread
 * checks for the divisibility of 3 and prints "Fizz". Another thread checks
 * divisibility of 5 and prints "Buzz". A third thread is responsible for
 * divisibility of 3 and 5 and prints "FizzBuzz". A fourth thread does the
 * numbers.
